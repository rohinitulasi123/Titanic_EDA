# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in the data to understand the factors affecting passenger survival.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The analysis uses:
- `train.csv` â€” Training dataset containing passenger details and survival status.
- `test.csv` â€” Test dataset for predictions.
- `gender_submission.csv` â€” Example submission file for Kaggle competition.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** â€” Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€” Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€” Interactive analysis

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Converting data types
3. **Visualization**
   - Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Survival rate analysis by gender, class, age
4. **Observations**
   - Women had higher survival rates than men.
   - Passengers in higher classes had better chances of survival.
   - Younger passengers had a slightly better survival rate.

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Plots
- Survival rate by gender
- Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors
- Correlation heatmap of numeric features
